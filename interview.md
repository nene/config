At the moment I am working in Fleet team.
Where my current work is with a new business portal that allows companies to sign up with Taxify and offer ride credit to its employees.
Just like within Taxify, where we offer a monthly ride credit for our own employees.
But now extending this service more widely outside Taxify as well.

# Summary:
Today I have a live coding task for you and I am here to answer your questions when you do this.
After the task we have 5-10 minutes and I can answer your questions regarding life in Taxify and in the Engineering team.

# About coding:
Before I give you the task, I would like to give a small overview on what we expect during the interview:

- It would be nice if you share your thoughts while you are coding.
- We don't check semicolons - what matters is idea correctness.
- If you hear keyboard sound it means I am taking notes
- We don't allow running code before both parties agree that it's finished
