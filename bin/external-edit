#
# Install:
# =======
# NOTE: These installation instructions are targeted towards a Debian
# system (such as Ubuntu). To install on a non-Debian system you will
# need to reinterpret these instructions.
#
# First you will need to install the required packages. So do the
# following as root:
#
#   apt-get install xbase-clients xautomation wmctrl xsel
#
# wmctrl is a "command line tool to interact with an EWMH/NetWM
# compatible X Window Manager". This means that this tip will not work
# if you are using a particularly old window manager, however most of
# the main WMs are okay -- including the default Gnome and KDE Window
# Managers. More info is available at the wmctrl link
# http://sweb.cz/tripie/utils/wmctrl/
#
# Put this script somewhere handy like ~/bin/external-edit and do
# chmod +x ~/bin/external-edit
#
# Usage:
# =====
# Using your favourite keygrabber/window manager bind a key
# combination (eg: Ctrl-Alt-V) to a command like one of the following:
#
#   external-edit /usr/bin/gvim -f
#   external-edit /usr/bin/emacs
#   external-edit /usr/bin/emacsclient -a emacs
#
# for my fluxbox/bbkeys configuration I have the following in my .bbkeysrc:
#
#   KeyToGrab(V), WithModifier(Mod1+Control), WithAction(ExecCommand), DoThis(/home/ben/bin/external-edit gvim -f)
#
# Note than the editor you specify must not fork (gvim -f). When
# executed the editor must allow the script to wait until the editor
# has finished executing.
#
# This script has been tested on both KDE and GNOME, from all of
# Firefox, Konqueror, Opera, launching all of Emacs[client], Gvim -f,
# Gedit and Kate. This does not mean that it will only work for these;
# it only means that if it works for these thirty-odd test cases, it
# is very likely that you will be able to get it to work as well.
# Note that although the focus here was on browsers (expecting
# TEXTAREA forms to be where an external editor would be most needed),
# you can also use this script to do crazy things like invoking vim to
# edit the contents of an Emacs buffer, and so on. (Extend The xte_
# functions appropriately.) --S

# editor plus arguments (except filename) passed on command line
editor=$*

# this gets the window id of the window with focus
winid=`xdpyinfo | sed -ne 's/^focus:.*\(0x[^,]\+\).*/\1/p'`

# For some reason (perhaps because I am using KeyTouch to launch this
# script from a keystroke), the winid got above is consistently wrong
# for GTK apps (like Firefox, Gaim, Xchat, ...), irrespective of
# whether I'm using GNOME or KDE. In these cases, it appears that a
# new window is created, with an id one more than the id of the actual
# window (don't know if this can be relied upon), and with width=1,
# height=1, and no name. For all other apps (KDE apps, Opera, etc...),
# it works fine. Hence the fix here. Maybe the original thing works
# for you, in which case the code below will never be executed. --S

if xwininfo -id $winid | grep "(has no name)"
then
  winid=`printf "0x%x\n" $(( $winid - 1 ))` #Decrement by one.
fi

# and this gets window title
wintitle=`xwininfo -id $winid | sed -ne 's/xwininfo: .*"\([^"]\+\)"/\1/p'`

# This script works by actually simulating the keystrokes that
# programs use for Select-All, Copy, and Paste. Different programs use
# different ones; so we use $wintitle to decide what to do. The common
# browsers (Firefox, Mozilla, Konqueror, Opera) seem to only differ in
# what they use for Select-All; so the rest of the functions are
# constant functions here. Write your own functions below if the ones
# here don't apply to your programs. Also, maybe it's better to use
# xprop and the WM_CLASS information instead of wintitle? --S

# xclip -selection clipboard -o > $mytemp

# invoke the editor, wait for it to finish
$editor $mytemp

# applications should be using the clipboard to paste!
xsel -b -i < $mytemp

# some applications have incorrect behaviour and use the primary
# selection to paste
